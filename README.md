# Convolutional Code Generator
Project for the *Electronics and Communications Systems* course (MSc Computer Engineering \@ University of Pisa).

The aim of the project was to design, simulate and synthesize an electronic cicuit which would generate **convolutional codes** from a given bit sequence.

The hardware description was written in **VHDL**, the simulation were carried out with **Modelsim** and the logical synthesis with **Vivado**.
